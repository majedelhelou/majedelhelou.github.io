:hourglass_flowing_sand: *~:hourglass_flowing_sand:Last updated March 2020~*

I am in my fourth PhD year at EPFL, with the Image and Visual Representation Lab [IVRL](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/). My research is in computational imaging and applied machine learning (touches on signal/image processing, estimation theory, deep learning, computer vision, and optics).

[//]: # (**For my publications** with IVRL, refer to the [publications page](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/publications/) of our lab or [my publications page here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/publications/).)

EPFL students looking for IC semester projects can send their own proposal (list of previously-supervised projects: [here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/teaching/project_supervision)).
