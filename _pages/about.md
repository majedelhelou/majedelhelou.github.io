I am currently in my third PhD year at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/), the first year was with the EDIC fellowship before joining the Image and Visual Representation Lab [IVRL](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/).

For my publications with IVRL, please refer to the [publications page](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/publications/) of our lab or [my publications page here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/publications/).

If you are an undergraduate EPFL student looking for an IC semester project, you can find the proposed projects of my lab [here](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/available-projects/). If you have your own idea, you can contact me to discuss it, I only require that it relates to my research interests. A list of my previously supervised projects can be found [here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/teaching/2014-spring-teaching-1).

If you are a non-profit organization, or a group of students, with an "improve the world" kind of project and need consulting or help with signal/image processing, computational imaging, computer vision, deep learning or general AI, do not hesitate to reach out. I would be glad to offer my help or at least put you in contact with field experts.
