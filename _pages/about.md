Currently a postdoc at EPFL's Image and Visual Representation Lab [IVRL](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/), my research is in computational imaging and applied machine learning (overlapping with image processing and computational photography, estimation theory, deep learning, optics, and computer vision).

Papers, code, and posters/presentations can be found on my [publications](https://majedelhelou.github.io/publications/) page.
Other resources (Patent demo, tutorial, datasets) are under [misc](https://majedelhelou.github.io/misc/). 
Past and current supervised projects are listed [here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/teaching/project_supervision).
