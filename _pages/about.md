Established researcher at ETHZ's [Media Technology Center](https://mtc.ethz.ch/), working on and supervising industry-based machine learning and computer vision projects, mostly with Align Technology and SRF. My main focus is on controllable and interpretable generative AI and visual media representation/understanding. 

Previously PhD/postdoc at EPFL's Image and Visual Representation Lab [IVRL](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/). My research was in computational imaging and applied machine learning (overlapping with image processing and computational photography, deep learning, computer vision, estimation theory, and optics).
