*~Last updated October 2019~
Do not hesitate to contact me with questions regarding publications/code.*

I am currently starting my fourth PhD year at EPFL, the first year was with the EDIC fellowship before joining the Image and Visual Representation Lab [IVRL](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/). My research is in image processing and machine learning (touches on signal processing and computational imaging, computer vision, deep learning and optics).

[//]: # (**For my publications** with IVRL, refer to the [publications page](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/publications/) of our lab or [my publications page here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/publications/).)

**Undergraduate EPFL students** looking for an IC semester project can check my lab's [proposed ideas](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/available-projects/) (or submit their own idea). A list of my previously-supervised projects: [here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/teaching/project_supervision).

**If you are a non-profit organization**, or a group of students, with a humanitarian project and need consulting or help with signal/image processing, computational imaging, computer vision, deep learning or general AI, do not hesitate to reach out. I would be glad to offer my help or at least put you in contact with field experts.
