*~Last updated March 2020~  
Do not hesitate to contact me with questions regarding publications/code.*

I am currently in my fourth PhD year at EPFL, the first year was with the EDIC fellowship before joining the Image and Visual Representation Lab [IVRL](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/). My research is in computational imaging and applied machine learning (touches on signal/image processing, estimation theory, deep learning, computer vision, and optics).

[//]: # (**For my publications** with IVRL, refer to the [publications page](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/publications/) of our lab or [my publications page here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/publications/).)

**Undergraduate EPFL students** looking for an IC semester project can check my lab's [proposed ideas](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/available-projects/) (or submit their own idea). A list of my previously-supervised projects: [here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/teaching/project_supervision).
