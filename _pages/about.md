Previously a Phd/postdoc at EPFL's Image and Visual Representation Lab [IVRL](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/). My research was in computational imaging and applied machine learning (overlapping with image processing and computational photography, estimation theory, computer vision, deep learning, and optics).

Papers, code, and posters/presentations can be found on my [publications](https://majedelhelou.github.io/publications/) page.
Other resources (patent, tutorial, data) are under [misc](https://majedelhelou.github.io/misc/). 
Past and current supervised projects are listed [here](https://majedelhelou.github.io/teaching/project_supervision).
