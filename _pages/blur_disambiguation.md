**- Closed-Form Solution to Disambiguate Defocus Blur in Single-Perspective Images (OSA Math, 2019)**

This is a pure optics publication, the only codes needed are for PSF estimation. We follow the ISO 12233 Slanted Edge methodology and base our implementation on this [library](http://losburns.com/imaging/software/SFRedge/sfrmat3_post/index.html) by Peter D. Burns.

Here is a nice [post](https://www.strollswithmydog.com/the-slanted-edge-method/) explaining the slanted edge method used for sub-pixel accuracy in PSF estimation.



**- Solving the Depth Ambiguity in Single-Perspective Images (OSA Continuum, 2019)**

This is the journal extension of the 2019 OSA Math paper cited above. We extend our explanations, derivations, experimental tests and results. Aside from the ISO PSF estimation, we also conduct experiments with off-the-shelf blur estimation algorithms all of which are referenced or also explained in detail in this journal paper.
